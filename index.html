<h1>Hi! I'm Ridge!</h1>
<p>Hello! It is really nice to meet you!!!</p>
<p>If you don't know who I am, I'm Ridgeway+  or if you like to call people by their first name online I'm Delilah! </p>
<p>I don't tend to code much except some websites (sometimes) but other than that I enjoy playing osu!, chilling in the Microsoft Community Discord server (discord.gg/microsoft) and talking to my girlfriend (i love youu acto :3) </p>
<p>You can find my GitHub profile at github.com/ridgewayplus (It would be nice if you could hit the follow button at the bottom of the page) and if you want to reach me send me a friend request on Discord (Ridgeway+#0001)</p>
<p>Other than that I don't think theres much else to know about me!</p>
<p>Thanks for checking my website out!</p>
